#Extended Block Addition Method
To enrich the programming experience with ICRobot, users can add extension blocks. These blocks function like modular add-ons in block-based programming. By dragging and combining them, users can create more advanced and diverse functionalities. For example:

+ **<font style="color:rgb(23, 26, 29);">Face Recognition Block:</font>**<font style="color:rgb(23, 26, 29);"> Detects and recognizes human faces in images. Suitable for interactive scenarios.</font>
+ **<font style="color:rgb(23, 26, 29);">Color Recognition Block: </font>**<font style="color:rgb(23, 26, 29);">Identifies the color of an object. Useful for sorting, tracking, and classification tasks.</font>

These extensions make ICRobot's coding more intuitive and powerful — ideal for users of different ages and skill levels.

_**Note: Extensions can only be used in Interactive Mode.**_
