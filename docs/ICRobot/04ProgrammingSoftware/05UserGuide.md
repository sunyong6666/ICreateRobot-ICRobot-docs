| Step 3: Drag the blocks into the coding area to start coding. | Step 4: After programming is complete, click the green flag to execute the program and observe the result. |


### Example
#### Scenario
Using AP mode, ICRobot connects to the PC and moves forward at full power for 1 second, then activates its robotic gripper once.

## Download Mode
### Usage Introduction
Programs created in the software can be downloaded to the ICRobot for independent execution. The steps are as follows:

Specify the download slot (1–5) within the software.

Download the program into one of ICRobot's five internal storage positions.

Based on the program content, the robot will perform the corresponding action commands.

| Step 3: Drag blocks into the coding area to begin creating your code. While doing so, the Python Code Area will display corresponding Python syntax in real-time. | Step 4: After completing the code, click the Download option in the Hardware Control Panel.<br/>Use the left/right arrows on the robot to select a program slot (1–5), then confirm download. |


### Example
#### Scenario
Using STA Mode, ICRobot connects to the PC. After downloading, the robot drives forward at maximum power for 1 second, then displays a custom dot-matrix pattern on its LED screen. The program is saved in Slot 3 of ICRobot’s memory.
